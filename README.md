# ZigBlog

A blog in ASP.NET MVC, it's supposed to be used as a demonstration of my knowledge in some technologies.

It makes use of the following technologies:

* C# 6.0
* ASP.NET MVC 5
* ASP.NET Identity (within this one I still need to implement login with third party services)
* MongoDB
* Bootstrap
* jQuery (includes jQuery.Validation, Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Ajax, Microsoft.jQuery.Unobtrusive.Validation)
* SignalR (I still need to implement some things with it, like live update of the comments section and of the like buttons)
